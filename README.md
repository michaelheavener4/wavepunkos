# WavePunkOS

A webcam-powered “air trackpad” for Linux (X11): pinch-to-touch, click/drag/scroll/right-click parity, subtle overlay, and power-user profiles — with a calm, guided onboarding flow.

## What it should feel like
- Like sliding on an invisible glass trackpad
- Pinch = touch down
- Release = instant stop
- Two-finger pinch = scroll
- Thumb+middle pinch = right-click
- Fist hold (1s) = panic OFF (always releases buttons)

## Non-negotiables
- Click never misses
- Drag never gets stuck
- Physical mouse + keyboard always still work
- Overlay is extremely subtle and never shows debug landmarks (debug only in Playground)
- If tracking is lost: immediately release and go safe

## v1 presets
- Default
- Precision
- Chill

## Build philosophy
ADHD-friendly micro-steps. No feature creep. Ship the core feel first.
